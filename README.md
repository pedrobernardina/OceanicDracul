VisualStudio OceanicNext + Dracula Stuff + What I find Nice

I wanted to use [awesome-vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/rafi/awesome-vim-colorschemes) OceanicNext colorscheme
but it looked too bad on my screen. Decided to change some colours based on [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim).

Still under dev.
